This project analyzes and visualizes file fragmentation across storage blocks. It simulates file allocation, calculates fragmentation score, displays block usage, and highlights scattered vs contiguous data. Features include:

🔹 Features

Real-time fragmentation calculation

Block-level visualization

Color-coded file allocation

Disk usage percentage

Random allocation simulation

Fragmentation history

Detection of highly fragmented files


🔹 Technologies Used

Python

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Flask (if used)

Matplotlib / charts (if used)


🔹 Purpose

This tool helps understand how fragmentation affects file system performance on HDDs/SSDs and supports OS learning with simulation-based visualization.
